Not that they do\n","not have holidays, they do! Somehow, the holidays do not\n","seem enough.My parents are treating COVID-19 patients and often discuss their healthcare. \n","At times, I \u001fnd their conversations scary and mom calms me down by saying this will end soon.\n","Yet, I am hardly convinced with her explanations. In the little time that I get to talk to \n","my friends, we discuss the current situation due to pandemic and its advantages, especially \n","on the environment, as us human beings are in lockdown.\n","A few days ago, when my father and I were sitting in the balcony at night I looked up in the\n","sky and saw a lot more stars than I usually get to see. Even my mom told me that Yamuna\n","river is getting cleaner amidst the lockdown.\n","I also feel that my friends have their parents at home, spending quality time with them and\n","all having fun times, together. While they have fun, my parents are at the hospital treating\n","patients and, of course, this is something that makes me very proud. Still, it is not the same\n","as having them at home.\n","However, the advantage of not having parents at home is that I do not have to do any work\n","until they are back. A few weeks ago, I panicked thinking that I would not get to celebrate my\n","birthday on its due date, just as it was not celebrated the previous three consecutive years on\n","the birthday day, since my parents were busy treating patients of either typhoid, pneumonia\n","or dengue. A sigh of relief, this year it does not matter that much as long as my family and I\n","are safe.\n","I am also anxious about school; I hope that they do not take away our summer holidays to\n","make up for the missed school days. I always enjoyed attending Bharatanatyam dance\n","classes but now, due to the lockdown, we have these classes on Zoom, which I can only\n","imagine, must be hard for the teacher as she tries to make it look e\u001eortless. These classes,\n","on the other hand, do us some good, as we do not get to copy someone if we need to.\n","On weekdays the school gives us work, which I sometimes \u001fnd overwhelming, but it is\n","more work on their side, so that is impressive. Another thing I like is the kind of e\u001eort the\n","teachers are making to teach us by newer methods like making videos of concepts and\n","even dance steps, so hats o\u001e to them for that!\n","On days when we do have homework, my parents when home check it, which is good\n","because after the tiring day at work they still spend time with us.\n","Out of the many things I have learned during the lockdown, one main thing is that my parents\n","keep reminding through their example that we should keep hope and stay positive. \n","The primary reasons for the American revolution were \n","1.

This\n","one was in a bad condition, the roll-top in several pieces,\n","one leg clumsily mended, scorch marks all down one\n","side. It was going for very little money. I thought I could\n","restore it. It would be a risk, a challenge, but I had to\n","have it. I paid the man and brought it back to my\n","workroom at the back of the garage. I began work on it\n","on Christmas Eve.\n","I removed the roll-top completely and pulled out the\n","drawers. The veneer had lifted almost everywhere — it looked like water damage to me. Both fire and water had\n","clearly taken their toll on this desk. The last drawer was\n","stuck fast. I tried all I could to ease it out gently. In the\n","end I used brute force. I struck it sharply with the side of\n","my fist and the drawer flew open to reveal a shallow space\n","underneath, a secret drawer. There was something in\n","there. I reached in and took out a small black tin box.\n","Sello-taped to the top of it was a piece of lined notepaper,\n","and written on it in shaky\n","handwriting: “Jim’s\n","last letter, received\n","January 25, 1915.\n","To be buried with\n","me when the\n","time comes.” I\n","knew as I did\n","it that it was\n","wrong of me to\n","open the box,\n","but curiosity\n","got the better of\n","my scruples. It\n","usually does.\n","Inside the box there was an envelope. The address\n","read: “Mrs Jim Macpherson, 12 Copper Beeches, Bridport,\n","Dorset.” I took out the letter and unfolded it. It was written\n","in pencil and dated at the top — “December 26, 1914\n","”.Dearest Connie,\n","I write to you in a much happier frame of mind because\n","something wonderful has just happened that I must tell you about at once. \n","We were all standing to in our trenches\n","yesterday morning, Christmas morning. It was crisp and\n","quiet all about, as beautiful a morning as I’ve ever seen, as\n","cold and frosty as a Christmas morning should be.\n","I should like to be able to tell you that we began it.\n","But the truth, I’m ashamed to say, is that Fritz began it.\n","First someone saw a white flag waving from the trenches\n","opposite. Then they were calling out to us from across\n","no man’s land, “Happy Christmas, Tommy! Happy\n","Christmas!” When we had got over the surprise, some of\n","us shouted back, “Same to you, Fritz! Same to you!” I\n","thought that would be that. We all did. But then suddenly\n","one of them was up there in his grey greatcoat and waving\n","a white flag. “Don’t shoot, lads!” someone shouted. And\n","no one did. Then there was another Fritz up on the\n","parapet, and another. “Keep your heads down,” I told the\n","men, “it’s a trick.” But it wasn’t.\n","One of the Germans was waving a bottle above his\n","head. “It is Christmas Day, Tommy. We have schnapps.\n","We have sausage. We meet you? Yes?” By this time there\n","were dozens of them walking towards us across no man’s\n","land and not a rifle between them. Little Private Morris\n","was the first up. “Come on, boys. What are we waiting\n","for?” And then there was no stopping them. I was the\n","officer. I should have stopped them there and then, I\n","suppose, but the truth is that it never even occurred to\n","me I should. All along their line and ours I could see\n","men walking slowly towards one another, grey coats,\n","khaki coats meeting in the middle. And I was one of\n","them. I was part of this. In the middle of the war we\n","were making peace.You cannot imagine, dearest Connie, my feelings as\n","I looked into the eyes of the Fritz officer, who approached\n","me, hand outstretched. “Hans Wolf,” he said, gripping\n","my hand warmly and holding it. “I am from Dusseldorf.\n","I play the cello in the orchestra. Happy Christmas.”“Captain Jim Macpherson,” I replied. “And a Happy\n","Christmas to you too. I’m a school teacher from Dorset,\n","in the west of England.”\n","“Ah, Dorset,” he smiled. “I know this place. I know it\n","very well.” We shared my rum ration and his excellent\n","sausage. And we talked, Connie, how we talked. He spoke\n","almost perfect English. But it turned out that he had\n","never set foot in Dorset, never even been to England.\n","He had learned all he knew of England from school,\n","and from reading books in English. His favourite writer\n","was Thomas Hardy, his favourite book Far from the\n","Madding Crowd. So out there in no man’s land we talked\n","of Bathsheba and Gabriel Oak and Sergeant Troy and\n","Dorset. He had a wife and one son, born just six months\n","ago. As I looked about me there were huddles of khaki\n","and grey everywhere, all over no man’s land, smoking,\n","laughing, talking, drinking, eating. Hans Wolf and I\n","shared what was left of your wonderful Christmas cake,\n","Connie. He thought the marzipan was the best he had\n","ever tasted. I agreed. We agreed about everything, and\n","he was my enemy. There never was a Christmas party\n","like it, Connie.\n","Then someone, I don’t know who, brought out a\n","football. Greatcoats were dumped in piles to make\n","goalposts, and the next thing we knew it was Tommy\n","against Fritz out in the middle of no man’s land. Hans\n","Wolf and I looked on and cheered, clapping our hands\n","and stamping our feet, to keep out the cold as much as\n","anything. There was a moment when I noticed our\n","breaths mingling in the air between us. He saw it too\n","and smiled. “Jim Macpherson,” he said after a while,\n","“I think this is how we should resolve this war. A football\n","match. No one dies in a football match. No children are\n","orphaned. No wives become widows.”\n","“I’d prefer cricket,” I told him. “Then we Tommies\n","could be sure of winning, probably.” We laughed at\n","that, and together we watched the game. Sad to say,Connie, Fritz won, two goals to one. But as Hans Wolf\n","generously said, our goal was wider than theirs, so it\n","wasn’t quite fair.\n","The time came, and all too soon, when the game was\n","finished, the schnapps and the rum and the sausage\n","had long since run out, and we knew it was all over.\n","I wished Hans well and told him I hoped he would see\n","his family again soon, that the fighting would end and\n","we could all go home.\n","“I think that is what every soldier wants, on both\n","sides,” Hans Wolf said. “Take care, Jim Macpherson.\n","I shall never forget this moment, nor you.” He saluted\n","and walked away from me slowly, unwillingly, I felt.\n","He turned to wave just once and then became one of\n","the hundreds of grey-coated men drifting back towards\n","their trenches.\n","That night, back in our dugouts, we heard them\n","singing a carol, and singing it quite beautifully. It was\n","Stille Nacht, Silent Night. Our boys gave them a rousing\n","chorus of While Shepherds Watched. We exchanged\n","carols for a while and then we all fell silent. We had had\n","our time of peace and goodwill, a time I will treasure as\n","long as I live.Dearest Connie, by Christmas time next year, this\n","war will be nothing but a distant and terrible memory.\n","I know from all that happened today how much both\n","armies long for peace. We shall be together again soon,\n","I’m sure of it.\n","'''"],"metadata":{"id":"tWPtu2wk6BRW","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1675709092635,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":277,"user":{"displayName":"Ahmed Toba","userId":"04457414598699327477"}}},"execution_count":77,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["question_4 = \"Who had written the letter?\"\n","question_5 = \"Why was the letter written — what was the wonderful thing that had happened?\"\n","question_6 = \"What jobs did Hans Wolf and Jim Macpherson have when they were not soldiers?\""],"metadata":{"id":"K9KuEa0qsqAx","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1675709129865,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":271,"user":{"displayName":"Ahmed Toba","userId":"04457414598699327477"}}},"execution_count":78,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["answer_4 = answer_by_longformer(context = context , question =question_1)\n","answer_5 = answer_by_longformer(context = context , question =question_2)\n","answer_6 = answer_by_longformer(context = context , question =question_3)"],"metadata":{"id":"5y3fICQMDCFC"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["## showing questions and answers :\n","\n","print(f'first question is : What is my parents profession? ____answer____---->{answer_4}')\n","print('\\n\\n')\n","print(f'seconf question is : \"What is one main thing I have learned during lockdown?\" ____answer____---->{answer_5}')\n","print('\\n\\n')\n","print(f'third question is : \"What were the reasons  for American revolution ?\" ____answer____---->{answer_6}')"],"metadata":{"id":"J49pZIVZDOsh"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
